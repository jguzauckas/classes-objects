# Pick one of the following concepts to build a class of (or choose your own!)
#   - Car (make, model, year, mileage, etc.)
#   - Smartphone (manufacturer, model, storage size, etc.)
#   - Shoes (brand, color, size, etc.)
#
# For your class, you should meet the following requirements:
#   - Have at least three attributes
#   - Have an __init__() and __str__() function
#   - Have at least one parameter with getter and setter methods
#   - Have two custom methods that do something with information
#   - One of your methods should have a parameter taken in
#
# With your completed class, effectively test it by:
#   - Creating two objects of that class
#   - Modifying a property of at least one object
#   - Print out the object to demonstrate the __str__() method
#   - Make at least one call to each of your methods
