# Create a BankAccount class that has a variable for name (str)
# and balance (float).
#
# Make sure you have __init__() and __str__() functions, and
# have the __str__() function format the balance to two decimal places.
#
# balance should be a property with a getter
# and setter method. Have the setter method check to make sure
# balance is not being set to a negative number.
#
# Create a method called payday that when called will add a predetermined
# amount to the account and return the new balance value.
#
# Create another method called spend that when called will subtract
# a parameter amount from the balance ONLY IF it is not bigger than
# the balance. If it is bigger than the balance, print a statement
# letting the user know about the issue. Don't return anything.


# Test your class by creating two bank account objects with different
# names and balances.


# Call the payday method on the first bank account and print out the
# current status of both accounts.


# Try to spend more money than the second bank account has, making
# sure it stops you.


# Spend a reasonable amount of money on both accounts and print
# out the current status of both accounts.
